\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present an application of the Software Defined Networks, focusing on the integration of the actual network with the SDN one.
We will show how it's possible to implement a QoS mechanism to keep the network up and to grant the users the possibility of using it outside
a laboratory.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The \textit{\textbf{SDN}, Software Defined Network} is a new approach to create a network of computer and networks, which is based on the
most famous OpenFlow protocol. The key concepts of this type of networks are the hierarchy, the flow control and the statistics.
The hierarchy allows a network administrator to set up a controller which will choose how to make the network evolve setting up
how the routing will switch the traffic and doing so, how the single switch will behave.
The flow control is done by the controller that, running the algorithm the network administrator created, choose the path for a
type of traffic that occurs between a source and a destinaion host.
The most important and interesting thing about those type of networks is the statistics: every switching unit collects data from its
interfaces (e.g. the number of packets going in or out through a specific port or interface). This allow the controller to instantly
how the network is evolving and, if necessary, switch a traffic from congestioned links to other that, in that moment, are almost fully loaded.
Exploiting the statistic capabilities is the key to manage wisely a network and, since there aren't many papers about these potentialities,
we decided to focus on that. In this paper we will show how we handled the contemporary traffic between multiple host, both inside SDN network
nd between the SDN one and the external internet. Starting from traffic analysis and going through the SDN state of the art, we implemented some function
to exploit better the SDN POX controller and we reach the end of this paper showing how we found three different types of traffic and
for each one, we provided different metrics and different path to optimize the load. We realized the controller using POX, a python-based controller
and we tested it with the switches that were provided us in the Communication Networks Lab at DEI.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:sota}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A good introduction about the SDN can be the  "Simulation in an SDN network scenario using the
POX Controller" where has been presented the SDN environment and the mininet simulation
tool that creates a topology where to simulate the switches, the traffic between hosts and
allow the controller to communicate with the switches. The work presented in
"Efficient topology discovery in OpenFlow-based Software Defined Networks" by F. Pakzad [put cit]
has been implemented to improve the controller speed and efficiency as it make it more reactive.
The introduction to the statistics power in a SDN network using the OpenFlow protocol has been found
in the paper called "Getting traffic statistics from network devices in an
SDN environment using OpenFlow" by D.J. Hamad & others. [ put note here]
For traffic analysis we haven't found any paper describing the characteristics of
some types of flows, so we used our PCs to sniff the traffic. Traffic analysis will be discussed in section \ref{sec:symo}.

\section{System Model}\label{sec:symo}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The System model is a description of your operating assumptions with related motivation and justification


\subsection{Traffic analysis}
We used laptop connected via
GigabitEthernet interface and Ethernet cable cat.5a to receive the traffic from the destination host.
Our laptop has been connected via Wi-Fi to our access point via protocol 802.11n.
No other traffic sources were active during the testing, so the router was handling only
the traffic from laptop when sniffing traffic. The connection used was an ADSL2+ via copper.
We did 3 type of traffic analysis: Gaming traffic, SkypeÂ® and torrent traffic. We analyzed
#Mb for the gaming traffic, #Mb for the VoIP traffic and 3GB for the torrent traffic.
The analysis involved the average number of packets per second, the packet size, the protocol (TCP or UDP)
